# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

 * It is a way to keep track of changes made to a file.  It is useful so you can track what changes were made and recall older versions.  This way if a mistake is made it's easier to find where the mistake happened.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

 * a Branch gives you a copy of your project to work on.  It is used for multiple people or a one person working on different sections of code that you then can merge together.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

 * a commit is a save point.  The commit message must be detailed and to the point.  It also has to tell what was changed to the file.

* What is a merge conflict?

 * If 2 people work on the same line of code and try merging them this is when a merge conflict typically happens.  There is no way to tell what version should be accepted and this is why the conflict happens.
