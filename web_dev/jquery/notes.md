I will spend 20 minutes reseraching and then take a 5 min break.  I like this approach because it gives a good amount of time to find resources, however it isn't too long.  The 5 min break gives you time to gather and think about what you found as well.

Google will be my main resource until I find a page I like.

I started to broad.  I had to start with learning what type of file jquery and how it was used.  Then I found it best to follow down one path until I understood that path using examples online.  I then would play with code I learned and try different things to test understanding.  I thghouth this worked well.  Once I learned one idea I moved onto the next.  The time breaks worked well.
