Release 3

1.  INNER JOIN: returns rows when there is a match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.

RIGHT JOIN: returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.

FULL JOIN: returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.

SELF JOIN: is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

CARTESIAN JOIN: returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables.

sqlite> SELECT GENRE, RATING FROM tv_show INNER JOIN network ON network.id = tv_show.network_id;
Superhero|7.8
Superhero|8.1
Fairy Tale Adaptation|7.9

sqlite> SELECT GENRE, RATING FROM tv_show FULL JOIN  network ON network.id = tv_show.network_id;;
Error: RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOINs are not currently supported

		Right and Full Out Join doesn't work

sqlite> SELECT tv_show.name, network.name FROM tv_show JOIN network ON tv_show.network_id = network.id;
